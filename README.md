## My process

- Prepare the project structure with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- Inspect the design, and style guide. Read the requirement
- Plan the different element to code
- Implement the HTML
- Implement styles for the mobile version
- Add media queries and adapt styles for the desktop version
- Adjust styles with [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/)
- Add clamp values where needed with [https://websemantics.uk/tools/fluid-responsive-property-calculator/](https://websemantics.uk/tools/fluid-responsive-property-calculator/)
- Test the solution with keyboard and adjust markup
- Test the solution with voice over and adjust markup
- Push the solution live
- Test the solution on Phone and Polypane
- Update README

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When writing css we should focus on low specificity and only add higher specificity if really needed.
It's better to not use to much indentation in scss as it can give very high specificity for elements and will be difficult to maintain.

I practiced grid with grid areas that made the layout switch between mobile and desktop very easy.

```css
.header {
  grid-area: header;
}

.pricing {
  grid-area: pricing;
}

.features {
  grid-area: features;
}

.container {
  min-width: 40rem;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "pricing features";
}
```

### Continued development

Update colors and font-sizes for better accessibility.
